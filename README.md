# resume-project

This project which some how looks like the LMS example but I did not copy the code from there I just follow the videos and wrote to code.


## link for my webpage

click here [click](https://manizha01.github.io/resume-project/) to see the page.

my resume project has 5 pages:

- page 1 (index.html) has personal information about me with some  jquery effect and footer

- page 2 (resume.html) shows my work history (which formatted in a very organized way) and my skills 

- page 3 (contact) which work email.js and user can send me email I have a mistake there if I put wrong email still it sends me email and I will try to fix it in future

- page 4 (Interest) in this page I add map API and show the places and put some columns with text.

- page 5 (githup) I put gitub link and I can search github account this is the difficult part.

- page 6 (download) this is not a page it is link to my resume when I click it opens my resume, I can download my resume from footer as well because I put a link there too.


# I will continue editing my readme file and resume
